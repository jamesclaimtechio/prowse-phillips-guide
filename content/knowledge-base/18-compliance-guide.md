# Compliance Guide

This guide covers the key regulatory requirements that affect your daily work. Understanding compliance helps protect both our clients and the firm.

---

## Overview

Our work is governed by several regulatory frameworks:

| Regulator | Area | Key Requirements |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| **SRA** | Legal services | Client care, transparency, professional conduct |
| **FCA** | Financial services | Credit agreements, consumer protection |
| **CCA** | Consumer credit | Section 77/78, default notices |
| **ICO/GDPR** | Data protection | Data handling, subject access, retention |

Non-compliance can result in disciplinary action, fines, and damage to client cases.

---

## SRA Requirements

The **Solicitors Regulation Authority** regulates legal professionals.

### Client Care Letter

Every client must receive a Client Care Letter before we begin work:
- Explains our services
- Sets out fees clearly
- Describes complaints procedure
- Confirms key terms

**Your responsibility:** Ensure clients sign the Client Care Letter during onboarding. Check this is complete before case work begins.

### Fee Transparency

We must be clear about fees:
- Total fee disclosed upfront
- How fees are calculated
- Payment plan terms
- No hidden charges

**Your responsibility:** If a client asks about fees, explain clearly and point them to their signed fee agreement.

### Professional Conduct

SRA Principles require:
- Acting in clients' best interests
- Acting with integrity
- Maintaining trust
- Upholding rule of law

**Your responsibility:** Always act professionally. If unsure about an action, ask a supervisor.

### Complaints Procedure

Clients have the right to complain. Our complaints procedure:
1. Client raises concern
2. We acknowledge within 2 working days
3. Full response within 8 weeks
4. If unresolved, refer to Legal Ombudsman

**Your responsibility:** Take complaints seriously. Escalate to management immediately.

### Record Keeping

SRA requires records to be kept for 6 years:
- All correspondence
- Client agreements
- Case files
- Financial records

**Your responsibility:** Log everything in the system. Don't delete records.

---

## FCA Requirements

The **Financial Conduct Authority** regulates credit-related services.

### The 12-in-12 Exemption

Our standard payment plan is **exempt from FCA regulation** if it meets ALL three criteria:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Instalments** | 12 or fewer payments |
| **Duration** | 12 months or less |
| **Interest** | No interest charged |

This is called the "12-in-12" rule.

**Your responsibility:** Understand which plan a client is on. Most clients are on 12-in-12 (exempt).

### Regulated Credit Agreements

If a client's plan doesn't meet 12-in-12 criteria, it's **regulated credit**:
- More than 12 instalments, OR
- Longer than 12 months, OR
- Interest is charged

Regulated credit requires:
- SECCI disclosure (Standard European Consumer Credit Information)
- Creditworthiness assessment
- Right to withdraw
- Additional documentation

**Your responsibility:** Understand the difference. Refer questions about regulated plans to a supervisor.

### Creditworthiness Assessment

For regulated credit, we must assess:
- Client's income
- Client's expenses
- Existing commitments
- Ability to repay

This is captured in the affordability assessment.

**Your responsibility:** Ensure affordability is complete and up-to-date for clients on regulated plans.

### Treating Customers Fairly (TCF)

FCA requires we treat customers fairly:
- Clear information
- Appropriate products
- No barriers to complaints
- Consider vulnerable clients

**Your responsibility:** Always act in the client's best interest. Flag vulnerable clients.

---

## Consumer Credit Act (CCA)

The **Consumer Credit Act 1974** governs credit agreements.

### Section 78 Requests

Under Section 78, creditors must provide:
- Copy of executed agreement
- Statement of account
- Within 12 working days

If they fail to comply:
- Agreement becomes unenforceable (for collection)
- They cannot pursue court action while in default

**Your responsibility:** Know the deadline (12 working days). Document non-compliance carefully.

### Section 77 Requests

Similar to Section 78, but for:
- Running-account credit (credit cards)
- Statement of account

**Your responsibility:** Understand when to use S77 vs S78.

### Default Notices

Under Section 87, before a creditor can enforce a debt, they must:
- Serve a valid default notice
- Give minimum 14 days to remedy
- Include accurate information

Invalid default notices can make enforcement unlawful.

**Your responsibility:** Look for default notice issues when reviewing DSAR responses.

### Prescribed Terms

Credit agreements must contain "prescribed terms":
- Amount of credit
- APR
- Repayment terms
- Total charge for credit

Missing prescribed terms can make the agreement unenforceable.

**Your responsibility:** Look for missing terms when reviewing Section 78 responses.

### Time Limits

| Action | Time Limit |
|--------|------------|
| Section 78 response | 12 working days |
| Default notice period | Minimum 14 days |
| Statute of limitations | 6 years from last payment |

## GDPR and Data Protection

The **General Data Protection Regulation** protects personal data.

### Lawful Basis for Processing

We process client data based on:
- **Contract** - To provide our services
- **Legal obligation** - Regulatory requirements
- **Legitimate interests** - Where appropriate

**Your responsibility:** Only access data you need for your work.

### Subject Access Requests (DSARs)

Under GDPR, individuals can request all their data:
- We use DSARs to get client data from creditors
- Creditors must respond within 30 days
- Failure to respond is a GDPR breach

**Your responsibility:** Document DSAR responses and non-responses accurately.

### Data Security

We must protect personal data:
- Use strong passwords
- Don't share login credentials
- Lock your screen when away
- Don't download data unnecessarily

**Your responsibility:** Follow security policies. Report breaches immediately.

### Data Retention

| Data Type | Retention Period |
|-----------|------------------|
| Client files | 6 years from case closure |
| Financial records | 6 years |
| Communication logs | 6 years |
| Unsuccessful applications | 3 years |

**Your responsibility:** Don't delete records. The system handles retention.

### Client Rights

Under GDPR, clients have rights:
- Access their data
- Correct inaccurate data
- Object to processing
- Data portability
- Be forgotten (with limitations)

**Your responsibility:** Take data requests seriously. Escalate to management.

### Data Breaches

A breach is:

**What to do:**
1. Stop the breach if possible
2. Report to your manager immediately

4. Don't try to cover it up

We must report serious breaches to ICO within 72 hours.

## Vulnerability

### Identifying Vulnerable Clients

Clients may be vulnerable due to:

### Reasonable Adjustments

We may need to:
