# Getting Started

Welcome to Prowse Phillips CRM! This guide will help you get oriented on your first day and understand the basics of navigating the system.

---

## What is Prowse Phillips CRM?

Prowse Phillips CRM is a debt contention case management system. We help clients who are struggling with debts by investigating whether those debts are legally enforceable. If we find issues with how the debt was set up or managed, we can help clients challenge it or negotiate better terms.

**The system has two main parts:**

1. **Staff CRM (Admin Portal)** - Where you work. This is where you manage clients, cases, documents, and communications.
2. **Client Portal** - Where clients log in to view their case progress, upload documents, and manage payments.

This documentation focuses on the Staff CRM - the system you'll use every day.

## Logging In

### Accessing the System

1. **Open your browser** and go to the admin portal URL (provided by your IT administrator)
2. **Enter your email address** - This is your work email
3. **Enter your password** - Your initial password was provided when your account was created
4. **Click "Sign In"**

### First-Time Login

## Staff Roles

Your role determines what you can see and do in the system. There are three main staff roles:

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **Sales** | View leads and incomplete onboarding, make initial contact with potential clients, limited case visibility |
| **Admin** | Full case management, send correspondence to clients and creditors, manage tasks and documents, view all clients |
| **Solicitor** | Everything Admins can do, plus the authority to approve legal documents like Letters of Claim (LOCs) and settlement proposals |

Your role is assigned when your account is created. If you believe you need different permissions, speak with your manager.

---

## The Dashboard

After logging in, you land on the dashboard. This is your home base - it shows you what needs your attention today.

[SCREENSHOT: Main dashboard with stats cards and activity feed]

### Dashboard Components

**Stats Cards (Top Row)**

These give you a quick overview of the system:
- **Active Cases** - Total number of cases currently in progress
- **My Cases** - Cases assigned to you
- **Pending Tasks** - Tasks waiting for completion
- **Overdue Items** - Anything past its due date (needs immediate attention)

**My Tasks Section**

Shows your upcoming and overdue tasks. Click any task to go directly to it.

**Recent Activity**

A feed of recent actions across the system - new clients, status changes, documents uploaded. Useful for staying aware of what's happening.

**Quick Actions**

Buttons for common tasks like "Add Client" or "View All Cases".

---

## Navigation

### The Sidebar

The left sidebar is your main navigation. It's organized into logical sections:

[SCREENSHOT: Admin sidebar with menu items expanded]

| Menu Item | What It Contains |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Dashboard** | Your home screen with overview stats |
| **Clients** | List of all clients, search and filter |
| **Cases** | List of all cases, search and filter |
| **Tasks** | Your task queue and team tasks |
| **Queues** | Work queues organized by case stage |
| **Approvals** | Documents waiting for solicitor approval |
| **Communications** | Email and SMS templates and history |
| **Creditors** | Database of creditor contact information |
| **Introducers** | Referral partners who send us clients |
| **Calendar** | Appointment scheduling and staff availability |
| **Staff** | (Admin only) Manage staff accounts |

### Collapsing the Sidebar

Click the hamburger icon (☰) at the top of the sidebar to collapse it. This gives you more screen space when working with data-heavy pages like case details.

## Finding Clients and Cases

### Global Search

The search bar at the top of every page lets you quickly find what you need:

1. **Click the search bar** or press `Ctrl+K` (Windows) or `Cmd+K` (Mac)
2. **Type your search term** - client name, email, phone number, or case reference
3. **Review results** - Results are grouped by type (Clients, Cases)
4. **Click a result** to go directly to that record

> **Tip:** Case references follow the format `DC-2024-00123`. You can search by the full reference or just the number portion.

### Using Filters

On list pages (Clients, Cases, Tasks), you'll find filter options:

1. **Click the filter icon** or "Filters" button
2. **Set your criteria** - Status, assigned handler, date range, etc.
3. **Apply filters** - Results update immediately
4. **Clear filters** - Click "Clear All" to reset

Common filter combinations:
- **My assigned cases** - Filter by "Assigned To: Me"
- **Cases needing attention** - Filter by "Status: Awaiting Response"
- **Overdue items** - Filter by "Overdue: Yes"

## Understanding Your Workspace

- **Actions** appear when you hover over a row (view, edit, etc.)
- **Pagination** at the bottom lets you navigate through large lists

### Detail Views

When you click on a client or case, you see the detail view:

- **Header** shows key information (name, reference, status)
- **Tabs** organize different types of information
